## Notes

### No excessive package dependencies

Collaboration Kit is split into multiple smaller packages so that excessive package dependencies can be avoided. You probably don't want to install React on your backend.

### Peer dependencies

A number of dependencies (React, Redux, Yjs) are [peer dependencies](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/configuring-npm/package-json#peerdependencies). Otherwise, [runtime bugs](https://github.com/yjs/yjs/commit/cbddf6ef90be3493661bb36a416627f86a0700b6) will occur due to version incompatibilities.
